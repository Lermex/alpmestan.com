Despite my interest in programming, I actually studied mathematics, and am very happy that I did so. I've had a lot of fun, and I still study some topics on my own. I will try to update this page, over time, with interesting links of books, articles and what not that I strongly recommend to anyone interested in the corresponding domain of mathematics.

# Books

- **Allen Hatcher**'s [Algebraic Topology](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) (freely available online) -- it's been a gold mine for me, since I pretty much specialized in this domain and its connections to related areas of maths. This is a very well written book, with actual explanations, unlike many other math books. Clearly a must-read for anyone interested in this domain. I also have been thinking about how to encode some of the structures covered there in Haskell, with no satisfactory solution for now.
- **E.T. Jaynes**'s [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science](http://omega.albany.edu:8008/JaynesBook.html) (a few chapters freely available online) -- while the usual interpretation of probabilities from a statistical viewpoint has its advantages, the bayesian approach (covered by this book) gets you, in my opinion, much further in understanding what probabilities are about, how you can reliably interpret them.
- [The Princeton Companion to Mathematics](http://www.amazon.com/Princeton-Companion-Mathematics-Timothy-Gowers/dp/0691118809) does a really good job at giving an overview of most of the areas of mathematics (and hence touches on some theoretical computer science) while keeping it relatively short for every topic, focusing on *the intuition* behind that topic -- which is something I value more than anything in any technical text, and where most math books/professors fail **miserably** in my opinion.

# Blogs

- If you are that kind of person, you can get a *category theory* fix for free on the [n-Category Caf√©](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) -- the archives of this blog have **a lot** of material
