# Books

- **Peter Norvig** and **Stuart Russell**'s [Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) is still, to the day, as far as I know, the best introductory textbook to artificial intelligence. It doesn't cover any topic *in depth* but gives a really decent intuition and overview of many techniques. They also took an original approach to exposing the material, which is appreciable.
- **Christopher Bishop**'s [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/) is still a great reference for learning the good old machine learning techniques. A good understanding of this material should let you understand the recent techniques (*deep learning* among others).
